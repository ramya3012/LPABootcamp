1. @keyframes logo-spin {
from {
transform: rotate(0deg);
}
to {
transform: rotate(360deg);
}
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
a:nth-of-type(2) .logo {
animation: logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
}
}

This CSS creates a rotation animation for a logo:

@keyframes logo-spin: Defines an animation called "logo-spin" that rotates an element from 0° to 360° (one complete rotation).

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference): A media query that checks if the user hasn't requested reduced motion in their system accessibility settings. This respects users who may get dizzy or uncomfortable with animations.

a:nth-of-type(2) .logo: Targets the .logo element inside the second <a> (anchor/link) element on the page. In your App.jsx, that's the React logo (the Vite logo is in the first link).

animation: logo-spin infinite 20s linear: Applies the rotation animation with:

infinite - never stops rotating
20s - takes 20 seconds to complete one full rotation
linear - constant speed throughout the rotation
So currently, the React logo rotates, not the Vite logo. To make the Vite logo rotate instead, change a:nth-of-type(2) to a:nth-of-type(1).

2.will-change: filter;
transition: filter 300ms; 

will-change: filter: Tells the browser to optimize for changes to the filter property. This is a performance hint that helps the browser prepare for upcoming animations/transitions, making them smoother by allocating resources in advance.

transition: filter 300ms: Creates a smooth transition effect when the filter property changes, taking 300 milliseconds (0.3 seconds).

With transition: The glow smoothly fades in over 300ms when you hover, and fades out when you leave. It's a gradual, smooth effect.

Without transition: The glow appears instantly when you hover and disappears instantly when you leave. No smooth animation - just an abrupt on/off switch.

will-change is just a performance optimization hint for the browser. The effect works fine without it, but might be slightly less smooth on lower-end devices.

Try removing those lines and hovering over the logos - you'll see the drop-shadow still works, just without the smooth fade animation!

3. index.css as a global stylesheet with sensible defaults for common HTML elements (links, buttons, headings, etc.). Even though you're not using text links right now, the styles are pre-configured so when you do add them, they'll look good without extra work.


index.css = Global styles for the entire app

Imported in main.jsx (the entry point)
Applies to all components in your app
Contains base styles for common HTML elements (h1, button, a, body, etc.)
Sets up global things like fonts, colors, dark/light mode
App.css = Component-specific styles

Imported in App.jsx
Contains styles specific to the App component only
Uses classes like .logo, .card, .read-the-docs
More specific/custom styles
Why this separation?

The h1 and button styles in index.css are base/default styles that apply everywhere
If you create other components with h1 or buttons, they'll automatically have these base styles
App.css adds additional custom styling on top of the base styles using classes
This follows React's pattern: global defaults in index.css, component-specific customization in component CSS files
So index.css provides the foundation, and App.css adds specific styling for the App component's unique needs!
